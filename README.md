# Lunarlanderv2
1st Deep Learning (Reinforcement Learning) project 

Did a reinforcement learning project on lunarlander v2 omn OpenAI's Gym library. Source: https://gymnasium.farama.org/4

Used Dueling Deep Q Network and the Deep Q Network to find the best Network for training a lunar lander to land.

Conclusion:
Dueling DQN consider the contribution of the state action to the overall value separately,which allows it to produce a more accurate result
Dueling DQN is the better model than DQN
